//So my cat was on my keyboard and now that's here. it's one letter away from killlllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll and came right before All, so now I'm a bit scared of my cat.

//All: search for your names or all for specific instructions.
//Working: trying to get angle to increase, then decrease. I'll get it, someday.
//As of now, I can easily get it to go back to 0 after reaching 15, but it's too much of a break than I'd like.
//  if(angle>=0){
//    angle++;
//    if(angle<=15){
//      angle--;
//    }
//  }
//  for (int a = 0; a<=15; a++){
//    a = angle;
//  }
//  for(int e = 15; e>=0; e--){
//    e = angle;
//  }
//  if (angle<=15) {
//    angle++;
//  } 
//  else {
//    angle--;
//  }

//    angle++;
